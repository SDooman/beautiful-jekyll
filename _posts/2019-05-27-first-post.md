Here's my resolutions for being a 25 year old:
 - Workout 5x a week
 - Download apps that remind me to drink water, eat food, breathe, etc.
 - Stop wearing a ski jacket & pants to bed every night 
 - Wash my one pair of socks
 - Stop yelling "here comes a big boy" whenever I see a truck
 - Eat more veggies

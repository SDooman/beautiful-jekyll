Hey, I'm Sam.  My current interests include, but aren't limited to:

Things I'm proud of:

 - I'm currently a software engineer at [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com), 
aiming to provide high quality fitness at home for everyone.  

 - I did my Masters under [Shriram Krishnamurthi](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/) and [Kathi Fisler](https://cs.brown.edu/~kfisler/), working on the first iteration of [Bootstrap Data Science](https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/data-science/).  The curriculum is now used in K-12 classrooms across the US.

 - I can play Claire de Lune

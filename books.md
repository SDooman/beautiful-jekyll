I'm currently reading 10 books.  More specifically,
there are 10 different books at any given time that
I've been interested in, purchased, got 2 chapters in,
then found another interesting one, purchased, etc.

I'd like to read more books.  To attempt this,
here is a list of books that either A) I have read and 
loved, B) are sitting on my shelf, or C) are in my cart.

Consider the following scenario;  A friend finds this list
and asks me about a particular book.  I turn to them, look
them in the eye, and say "I haven't actually read that.  I
started, but then I jumped on Halo Matchmaking and went 25 and 6 in
big team battle on Valhalla.  Then I oscillated between
Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn at 40Hz for about 70
minutes and went to bed feeling a vague sense of malaise".

Hopefully, by creating this list and opening up the above
as a potential source of embarassment, I'll kick my own ass
into a book heavier diet.

Eventually, this list will be organized.  Maybe even in a 
useful way.
